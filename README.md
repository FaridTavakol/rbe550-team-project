# Motion Planning for Needle Steering Robot

## Overview
This is the final project for the course, "RBE 550 - Motion Planning" at WPI. In this project, the main goal was to develop a motion planning algorithm for a steerable needle robot built at AIM Lab, WPI. The detailed report can be found in the "Report" folder. 

For a quick reference, here's a brief of all that was explored and implemented from scratch:
- [MATLAB] Kinematic Modelling of the needle as a modified Bicylce model.
- [C++] Spline-based RRT and RRT* algorithms for path planning in 3D space.
- [MATLAB] Duty-cycling and CURV steering methods for trajectory planning.
