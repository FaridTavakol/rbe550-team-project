All positions are in [x,y,z] format.
Start and goal positions would be the 1st and the last entry in each smooth_path file. 



----------------CASE 1----------------
start	= [15,15,0]
goal	= [15,15,350]	 

Obstacle1:

radius	 = 10


----------------CASE 2----------------
start	= [25,25,0]
goal	= [25,25,250]
